# DeepImageClassify
Image classification is one of the core problems in computer vision. The success of an image classification task depends significantly on the dataset being used and the model architecture. Changes in activation functions
and loss functions, newer data preprocessing methods and optimization procedures performs a vital role in improving existing image classification models. 

In this project, we explored the impact of using different custom activation functions on the **ResNet50** architecture and then the obtained results wwas compared with a model trained using **transfer learning**. 
For the transfer learning, the base model was based on ResNet50 using pretrained weights from Imagenet and then the model was fine-tuned for better accuracy.
